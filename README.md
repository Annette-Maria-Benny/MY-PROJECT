Project Plan Builder – Report
Project Title
Project Plan Builder

Objective
To develop an AI-powered tool that automatically generates a detailed and structured project plan by analyzing project-related documents. The goal is to simplify and speed up the process of project planning by minimizing manual effort and human error.

Project Overview
Project Plan Builder is an intelligent, document-aware application designed to assist users in quickly creating project plans. By uploading documents such as proposals or requirements, users can generate a task-oriented project plan using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The tool extracts relevant data from documents and turns it into a clear, step-by-step plan including tasks, timelines, and deliverables.

Problem Statement
Project managers and teams often receive unstructured documents containing project goals or requirements. Manually reading these and drafting a detailed plan can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone. There is a clear need for an automated system that can interpret these documents and generate structured plans efficiently.

Solution Description
Project Plan Builder allows users to upload any project-related document (PDF, DOCX, TXT). It extracts content using document parsers, applies NLP techniques to identify relevant information, and transforms the insights into a complete project plan. The output includes project phases, tasks, goals, and optionally timelines and visualizations.

Key Features
Document Upload: Supports PDF, DOCX, and text file formats

AI-Powered Analysis: Uses NLP to understand goals, tasks, and dependencies

Automated Planning: Structures tasks based on document content

Timeline Suggestions: Predicts rough task durations and order

User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for simple and interactive use

User Interface Output

Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language

Streamlit – Frontend and UI framework

PyMuPDF / python-docx – For extracting text from PDFs and Word documents

NLTK, spaCy – Natural language processing libraries

Sentence Transformers – For understanding semantic meaning in documents

Pandas – Data organization and structuring

Plotly / Matplotlib – For visualizing timelines (optional)

Working Process
The user uploads a document containing project information

Text is extracted and cleaned

NLP techniques analyze the content and extract:

Objectives

Tasks and subtasks

Phases or milestones

Possible timelines

The final plan is structured into tables or visual formats and displayed in the UI

Example Use Case
A project manager receives a business proposal describing a new product idea. Instead of manually writing a project plan, they upload the document into Project Plan Builder. The tool automatically identifies phases like research, design, development, testing, and deployment, along with key tasks under each phase. The manager gets a ready-to-review project plan within minutes.

Benefits
Saves time by automating initial project planning

Improves accuracy and consistency

Reduces dependency on manual document analysis

Makes project planning accessible to non-experts

Can be adapted for different domains (IT, research, education, construction, etc.)

Challenges Faced
Handling vague or incomplete descriptions in documents

Parsing and cleaning documents with different formats and structures

Ensuring accurate mapping between text and real project phases

Maintaining flexibility while keeping the generated plan useful and structured

Future Improvements
Support for multiple document uploads

Export project plan as PDF, Excel, or JSON

Integration with project management tools (like Jira or Trello)

Interactive Gantt chart generation

Feedback system for refining future project plans

Conclusion
Project Plan Builder showcases the power of combining NLP and document intelligence to solve a real-world problem — project planning. It simplifies the early stages of project execution by automating the transformation of unstructured input into structured outputs. This tool is practical, scalable, and highly relevant in both enterprise and academic environments.
